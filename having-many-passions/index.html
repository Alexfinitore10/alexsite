Yet I tend to develop a form of obsession to a new one every time I encounter it. To be clear I'm not trying to say that every little thing that I see regarding the PC sphere becomes a passion, but I span to a variety of arguments. From Computer Networks to Videogames modding. From Video editing to Programming videos. Every time that I want to do some sort of productive thing I become involved in that little niche of knowing why doing this thing or not and how, what's the best way? What's the most user practiced way? And every time I'm entering this little rabbit hole, I encounter a new or old passion of mine. So i become obsessed with it. In the end? I'm doing nothing but a little of progress in the first thing that I liked but wasting a lot of time into developing other million of things, somewhat related to the topic. It's a little bit stressful, indeed, in fact would like to try and focus more on one task, over the other.<br><br>This problems is also transposed on my daily duties on PC. While I have to do a thing, I will be actually distracted from the main task and I start going from thing to thing, as like I need to go from different topic to different topic just to amuse myself of some kind. This is obviously toxic and not productive at all, and the quantity of distractions these days is absurd. Every time a new thing discovered, a new command I encountered, a new little problem that I don't want to leave that way so I have to search how to fix it in order to let me live in peace. <br><br>It's not doable, honestly, so, even though, I started creating some rules for myself, like not watching youtube for leaning "this" useful or useless thing that seems pretty interesting. I start to leave things this way just to counter attack my wave of fixing things on the OS. And I assure you that living with Unix OS's leaning new things everyday it's a common thing. <br><br>Also changing things compulsively it's a struggle that I have, from wanting to change to a new desktop environment, to wanting to use another app for messaging, to changing the vscode theme, ecc. <br><br>And also falling in love with many computer science paths that are very compelling to my eyes. It's also energy draining as well.<br><br>So being truly concentrated it's a bit complicated these days for me. <br><br>In another article we will explore some other struggles of my career path. The difficulties that I encounter and thoughts about everyday life and work life. So stay tuned</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 7, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://alexfinitore10.github.io/alexsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://alexfinitore10.github.io/alexsite/authors/alex-ciacciarella/" rel="author">Alex</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://alexfinitore10.github.io/alexsite/first-post/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Decisions Decisions</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://alexfinitore10.github.io/alexsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://alexfinitore10.github.io/alexsite/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
